test1 contains files that are all in the reactant basin (basin A)
test2 contains files that are in basin A, basin B, and one that is not clearly either. Since I used 300 timestep, upped it to 400
test3 uses the same starting point as test2 using 400 timesteps to travel
test4 uses starting point 160 with updated script that calculates probB every round
test5 uses starting point 160 without updated script. Makes sure 160 will still be rejected with more data points
